MyShell is the creation that allows a user to input nine different commands and execute them in the terminal. In MyShell, there are functions that do the following:
createdThread()- Executes the command in a separate thread and exits the child thread
inputLoop()- takes a user input and parses it to check for any of the nine commands. If the command is found it calls createThread(), else it continues to run until the user enters "exit" or "quit"  

The following commands are usable for the Windows environment  
1) dir- lists files in the current directory
2) help- provides online commands for the current environment
3) vol- display the volume label and volume serial drive
4) path- display a path to the current working folder
5) tasklist- displays a current list of running tasks
6) notepad- runs the notepad program
7) echo- returns typed text back to the user
8) color- change the color of text in the terminal
9) ping- sends a packet of data to a given IP address
